## Introduction
The 2030 Agenda acknowledges that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development. 

The first Sustainable Development Goal aims to “End poverty in all its forms everywhere”. Its seven associated targets aims, among others, to eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty, and implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable.

As recalled by the foreword of the 2015 Millennium Development Goals Report, at the Millennium Summit in September 2000, 189 countries unanimously adopted the Millennium Declaration, pledging to “spare no effort to free our fellow men, women and children from the abject and dehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty”. This commitment was translated into an inspiring framework of eight goals and, then, into wide-ranging practical steps that have enabled people across the world to improve their lives and their future prospects. The MDGs helped to lift more than one billion people out of extreme poverty, to make inroads against hunger, to enable more girls to attend school than ever before and to protect our planet.

Nevertheless, in spite of all the remarkable gains, inequalities have persisted and progress has been uneven. Therefore, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its set of Sustainable Development Goals have been committed, as stated in the Declaration of the Agenda, “to build upon the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals and seek to address their unfinished business”.

The theme of the 2017 High-Level Political Forum was "Eradicating poverty and promoting prosperity in a changing world”", and it included SDG 1 as one of the focus SDGs.[^1]

Earlier this year, the United Nations published a comprehensive report on the current worldwide situation. According to the report, the COVID-19 pandemic has so far cost the lives of close to 15 million people. But that’s just the beginning of the pandemic’s terrible impact. The UN mentions overwhelmed healthcare systems, millions living in poverty, the increase in domestic violence and many other significant problems.[^2] The COVID-19 pandemic wiped out more than four years of progress on poverty eradication and pushed 93 million more people into extreme poverty in 2020.[^3]

## Problem Statement
The COVID-19 has severely impacted rural livelihoods. In disadvantaged communities in the Philippines, loss of income and job possibilities were the main issues. Because the studied neighborhoods are already a subset of the Philippines' poorest and most vulnerable areas, the economic impact of COVID-19 is especially concerning. Communities are at danger of seeing future rises in poverty following large employment and income losses[^4].The virus's lockdowns have led to a considerable decline in the job market, which has exacerbated COVID-19's effects on poverty in the Philippines. The Philippines' unemployment rate was around 5% at the start of the pandemic, but lockdown measures have caused it to rise. The COVID-19 pandemic, according to the Philippines Statistics Authority, caused an increase in unemployment to 17.6% in April 2020. Furthermore, as lockdown tactics continue, the number could climb, resulting in higher rates of poverty and hunger. Poverty has increased as a result of more unemployment; estimates suggest that by the end of 2020, about 3 million Filipinos will become poor. Although the effects of COVID-19 on poverty in the Philippines are only short-term, they might be mitigated with the correct policies and the removal of lockdown measures as rates and immunizations are introduced [^5].

According to Reuters (2022), About 2.3 million people in the Philippines were pushed into poverty between 2018 and 2021, largely due to the economic downturn caused by the pandemic. The number of people living in poverty in 2021 rose to a total of almost 20 million or 18.1% of the population from 16.7% in 2018, the Philippine Statistic Authority (PSA) said, overshooting the government’s target of 15.5%-17.5%. According to PhilStar Global (2022),More Filipinos ended poor in 2021 compared to three years ago after the pandemic wiped out gains in poverty reduction that took years to achieve.

### Significance of the Proposed Project
Current estimations are that between 657 and 676 million people live in extreme poverty. The pre-pandemic projection was much lower – 581 million. In 2022 alone, this number increased by at least 76 million. COVID-19 caused significant economic and social costs in the short term. Though we believe that the pandemic is only a temporary fad, it has forced many vulnerable households living on the outside back into poverty. This project's goal is to supply an explanatory analysis of the progress of Poverty in the Philippines erased by Covid-19. This project will provide a variety of data sets exemplifying poverty caused by covid-19 in the Philippines. This research will be useful for the following purposes:

To the **Students** who will be needing data that may be found from the project. This will allow them to have a thorough understanding of the Philippines' poverty throughout time.

To the **Teachers** who will be teaching about poverty in the Philippines through the years. The information collected in the project can be utilized in their courses.

To the **Government Officials** who will be needing data that they may use for their future project/s related to poverty. 

To the **Future Researchers** to provide background knowledge concerning poverty in the Philippines. This project's analytics can provide them with new insights, suggestions, and conclusions.

## Methods
There are numerous studies on the pandemic's impacts on poverty, but the growing discussions and research on the pandemic's effects on the Philippines' poverty rate offer a potential to produce new empirical evidence and knowledge on this subject. Therefore, carrying out empirical research is a suitable way to expand upon and investigate fresh research. The article's main goal is to analyze data on adaption strategies in the context of the Philippines and draw conclusions. 

## Expected Output
Prior to drawing any assumptions, the goal of the study is to find broad patterns in the data that could help the researcher. If the analysis's findings are corroborated and show a connection between the variables—or, conversely, if the findings are deteriorating—they can be used to raise the public's understanding of the need in making solutions in the effects of pandemic on the rate of poverty and to inform future research that will result in a sound strategic plan. The government can also make adjustments and pick up tips from other nations that have effectively developed a strategic strategy in addressing the issues with regards to the effect of the pandemic on the poverty in the country.
